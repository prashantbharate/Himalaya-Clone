                    COURT OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO
                    A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE
                    LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.</strong> <br><br>

                <strong> ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER
                    PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW,
                    INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND US ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN
                    ANY WAY TO YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE SITE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND
                    FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION.</strong> <br><br>
                The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with
                the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Section 12.
                (The AAA Rules are available at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal
                Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.

                The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or
                enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other
                challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. The
                arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in
                equity. Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be
                entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR HIMALAYA HERBAL
                HEALTHCARE WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN
                ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A
                PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's
                claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The
                arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any
                challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.

                If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will
                be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.
            </li><br><br>
            <li class="para1"> <strong> Assignment.</strong> You will not assign any of your rights or delegate any of
                your obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any purported assignment or
                delegation in violation of this Section 13 is null and void. No assignment or delegation relieves you of
                any of your obligations under these Terms.</li><br><br>
            <li class="para1"><strong> No Waivers.</strong> The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these
                Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any
                right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative
                of Himalaya Herbal Healthcare.</li><br><br>
            <li class="para1"><strong>No Third Party Beneficiaries.</strong> No Third Party Beneficiaries. These Terms
                do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you.</li><br>
