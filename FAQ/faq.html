        Frequently Asked Questions

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        Can you provide me with the exact amount of each ingredient in your
        formulas? In other words, how many milligrams of each ingredient make
        up the formula

          Himalaya herbal formulas are proprietary, which means that they are
          protected by trademark. It is the labeling rights of all
          manufacturers to present a proprietary formula with one total
          milligram amount. Every botanical ingredient is an integral part of
          the synergistic function of the formula, which is uniquely designed
          to support all relevant systems in the body, but to give a detailed
          recipe of amounts would be inviting duplication and endangering our
          trademarked products and their utmost quality. To develop such a
          comprehensive herbal formula, and to back each formula with a
          sufficient set of clinical trials that proves the formula to be safe
          and effective, is an 8-10 year process. Because Himalaya formulas
          are sold as herbal pharmaceuticals and OTC products in many
          countries around the world, our demand for the highest standards of
          excellence a part of our business model. Since its inception, the
          company has focused on developing safe, natural and innovative
          herbal products that help people worldwide. Today, over 300,000
          doctors endorse Himalaya products worldwide, and consumers in more
          than 80 countries rely on Himalaya to support their health. We trust
          this builds confidence in the comprehensive and proprietary nature
          of our formulas.

        What is the source of the vegetable glycerin and xanthum gum in your
        toothpaste?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The vegetable glycerin comes from sustainable palm oil and rapeseed
          oil and the xanthum gum comes from the fermentationof glucose by the
          bacteria Xanthomonas campestris (non-GMO strain) from non-GMO maize
          as well as beet sugar and sugarcane.

        How much Vitamin C is in your Amla ?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          We used to call our product “Amla C,” but when evidence became clear
          that Vitamin C was being misidentified by coeluting mucic acids, we
          changed our product name from “Amla C” to simply “Amla.” Until
          further studies either bear it out or help us understand Amla’s
          ascorbic acid content better, we have distanced ourselves from
          marketing our Amla as a measurable source of Vitamin C and prefer to
          just present it for its use as an antioxidant. It’s not that it
          doesn’t contain any Vitamin C. It’s just that it’s very hard to
          measure it by contemporary standards.

        <p>
          We do not recommend Himalaya supplement products or anyone’s

          pregnant or nursing, any supplement you take should be discussed

        People get worried about products comming from other countries.What do
        to ensure the quality of every product in your line?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          For Himalaya, the complexity and timing of our unique process is
          highlighted by three important company mandates: purity, efficacy,
          and batch-to-batch consistency. All of our products are made in
          India and batch tested at THREE points in the process: after
          harvest, after the extraction, and after final tableting or
          encapsulating. These tests include potency, profile, heavy metals,
          microbial count, and pesticides. See our quality section here on the
          website for more detailed information.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        Why is there vegetable glycerin in your toothpaste? Iheard it erodes
        tooth enamel.
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          A search for published scientific data on the National Library of
          Medicine did not produce any validation to unfounded internet claims
          and rumors that glycerin affects enamel. No evidence currently
          exists to substantiate that claim. Our toothpaste, like many other
          commercial and natural health industry toothpastes, contains
          vegetable glycerin in order to provide a vehicle into which oral
          care agents can be incorporated. It produces a smoothly blended
          mixture that provides resistance to drying out, rapidly releases the
          flavor and therapeutic herbal agents, thickens paste structure,
          provides stability, regulates the amount of foam, imparts sweetness
          and makes the overall tooth brushing experience pleasant.

        Is Your toothpaste safe for denture wearers?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          There are two types of partial denture – fixed and removable. Fixed dentures are made using metal or ceramic
          whereas removable dentures are usually a combination of acrylic and metal or acrylic alone. Our toothpaste can
          be used without any issues with fixed partial dentures, but is not recommended for removable dentures.
          Removable dentures wearing people brush their natural teeth after removing the denture and clean the denture
          outside the mouth using tap water or a basin. Our toothpaste can be used in fixed partial dentures and
          implants also, but we have not conducted any studies exclusively for implants.
